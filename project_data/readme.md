# Project Data

- **movie_dialogue.tsv** contains dialogue and gender for close to 3,000 characters from around 600 movies. This data is from the [Cornell Movie-Dialogue Corpus](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~cristian/Cornell_Movie-Dialogs_Corpus.html) public dataset. 

- **movie_titles_metadata.tsv** contains metadata for each movie included in the movie_dialogue dataset and is available as part of Cornell's Movie-Dialogue Corpus.

- **pudding_movies.csv** is downloaded from [The Pudding's Film Dialogue](https://pudding.cool/2017/03/film-dialogue/) analysis and is used to get the imdb ids for the majority of the movie titles in the Cornell dialogue dataset.
 
- missing_title_imdb_ids.csv contains the imdb ids for the titles that I had to manually search for because there was no match in the pudding data.
